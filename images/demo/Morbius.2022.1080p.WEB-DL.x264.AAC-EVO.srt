1
00:02:58,225 --> 00:03:00,561
We shouldn't be here
when it gets dark.

2
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:12,805
Set the trap at the mouth
of the cave, please.

3
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:22,650
You need a doctor?

4
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,352
I am a doctor.

5
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:28,689
It's impressive, don't you think?

6
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:31,091
Vampire bats weigh almost nothing,

7
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:33,661
but they can down a creature
nearly ten times their size.

8
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:42,969
Wow.

9
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:46,140
What are you using as bait?

10
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:47,675
You volunteering?

11
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:50,277
Leaving.

12
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,147
Pay me now.

13
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:56,049
Before the sun goes down.

14
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,628
You throw in that bushcrafter
on your belt and we have a deal.

15
00:04:56,477 --> 00:04:58,044
Come on.

16
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:10,591
Move!

17
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:33,480
Should be able to
take better care of you here.

18
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:40,187
Everyone's here to help you.

19
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:45,626
Michael, this is Lucian.
Lucian, Michael.

20
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,228
Michael knows more
about this place than I do.

21
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:50,864
Play nice.

22
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,600
Hello.

23
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:55,636
Hello, Milo.

24
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,337
My name's Lucian.

25
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:01,341
The person
who was here before was Milo.

26
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:02,975
No.

27
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,312
He was also the new Milo.

28
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:07,815
And before him
was the other new Milo.

29
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:10,484
I don't even remember the first Milo.

30
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:13,220
How long have you been here?

31
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:16,123
Long as I can remember.

32
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:19,126
- And you're still not cured?
- There is no cure.

33
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,329
There's something missing
from our DNA.

34
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,264
<i>Like a piece of a puzzle.</i>

35
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:27,468
<i>And until they find it,
the only way to stay alive</i>

36
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,870
<i>is an oil change three times a day.</i>

37
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:37,344
What would you do
if you could be normal?

38
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:39,413
Just for an hour?

39
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:43,450
I don't think about it.

40
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:46,253
Hey, look at the freaks!
Look at them!

41
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:54,561
Best not to be outside
when school gets out.

42
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:56,530
Like the original Spartans,

43
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:59,566
we are the few against the many.

44
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:06,907
Milo?

45
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:09,843
Milo?

46
00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:11,945
Nurse?

47
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:22,956
Okay...

48
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:32,766
Lucian.

49
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:35,936
Lucian!

50
00:07:42,843 --> 00:07:44,678
With one of these?

51
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,080
It took a team of scientists
to build that machine

52
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:49,416
and you fixed it
with a ballpoint pen?

53
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:58,625
There's a school
for gifted children in New York.

54
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,696
I think that I could get them
to agree to cover your tuition

55
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:06,600
and provide private care
to help manage your condition.

56
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:10,571
Somewhere you could study,
learn, hone your skills.

57
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:15,008
You have a gift, Michael.

58
00:08:15,142 --> 00:08:18,946
I don't think I could forgive
myself if I saw it go to waste.

59
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:21,548
<i>"Dear Milo,</i>

60
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:23,283
<i>"this isn't goodbye.</i>

61
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:25,619
<i>"I'm gonna find a cure for us,</i>

62
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:28,221
<i>"so we can be cranky old men someday.</i>

63
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:30,457
<i>"Your friend, Michael.</i>

64
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:32,426
<i>"P.S. You shouldn't
have unfolded this.</i>

65
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,628
<i>"Now you'll never
get it back together.</i>

66
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:36,563
<i>See you this summer."</i>

67
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:39,499
No.

68
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:47,140
"Dear Milo..."

69
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:49,142
Please, can I have my letter back?

70
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:51,945
- What?
- Please, can I have my letter?

71
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,280
Okay. Here.

72
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:57,284
Please. Ah!

73
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,653
Please!

74
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:01,755
Please!

75
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:06,393
Stop.

76
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,400
Go away!

77
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:20,073
Let me have a look.
Let me have a look.

78
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:23,243
He tried to steal my letter!

79
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:25,278
Milo, Milo, stop.

80
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:27,648
Stop. Stop. Stop.

81
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:30,050
What about Milo?

82
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:32,686
I'll look after Milo.

83
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:34,021
He needs me.

84
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,626
Michael Morbius
completed his doctorate by 19

85
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,795
and quickly established himself

86
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:46,066
as the world's leading authority
on blood-borne diseases.

87
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:48,368
His development of artificial blood

88
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:52,039
has saved more lives than penicillin.

89
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:54,174
Michael Morbius,

90
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:56,309
please step forward

91
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:58,545
to acknowledge
the receipt of your prize

92
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:01,848
from His Majesty, the King of Sweden.

93
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:19,533
I can't believe you
dissed the king of Sweden.

94
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,702
The king and the queen,
their loyal subjects,

95
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:26,073
all of Scandinavia and
the entire scientific community.

96
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:28,008
Yeah, but who does that?

97
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:31,745
Well, Anna, we both know
I have issues.

98
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:34,748
But, hey, I kept the program.

99
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,456
There you are.

100
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,624
- Hey, Dr. Bancroft.
- Hey, Anna.

101
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:47,627
- We going to play?
- Oh, I don't think so.

102
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:50,630
See, now that Dr. Morbius
is back,

103
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:52,632
maybe you should
try losing for a while,

104
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:55,602
- see how that feels.
- Not gonna happen.

105
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:58,038
- Michael.
- Uh, yes?

106
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:00,474
- You got a minute?
- Of course.

107
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:03,410
New one. For your collection.

108
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:07,881
Dr. Morbius is in trouble.

109
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:10,383
I'm in trouble.

110
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:12,719
"I can't accept a prize

111
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:15,455
for the by-product
of a failed experiment."

112
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:17,457
- Lab 1.
- Front page,

113
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:22,295
"American Scientist
Rejects Nobel Prize."

114
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:24,598
You know that people
actually like writing checks

115
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:26,466
to Nobel laureates?

116
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,736
Makes them feel better
about their investment.

117
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,141
It would help if you stuck
around long enough to cash them.

118
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:35,143
You're pushing yourself

119
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:36,777
too hard.

120
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:42,349
Does our generous benefactor, Milo,

121
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:44,684
know what you're actually doing here?

122
00:11:44,818 --> 00:11:46,820
What am I actually doing here?

123
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:50,091
Remixing human DNA with bat DNA.

124
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:53,194
- I have no idea what you're...
- Talking about?

125
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:55,996
Is anything ringing a bell?

126
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,132
No bells ringing. Uh...

127
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:00,834
Okay. Maybe this
will jog your memory.

128
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:03,370
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

129
00:12:10,544 --> 00:12:11,745
That is a...

130
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,980
- It's a fish tank.
- Hmm.

131
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:15,249
Like, for...

132
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:17,185
flying mammals.

133
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:19,686
Oh, I see.

134
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,855
Some friends I brought back
from Costa Rica.

135
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:24,091
So when were you gonna tell me?

136
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,995
More importantly,
how did you get my pass code?

137
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,831
It's the first six digits
of pi backwards.

138
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:32,532
It's your password for everything.

139
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,000
You should change that.

140
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:35,969
You could lose your license for this.

141
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:39,873
I'm not gonna need it
much longer, doctor.

142
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:43,710
You, on the other hand, will.

143
00:12:45,712 --> 00:12:48,715
You know, there's something
called "plausible deniability."

144
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:50,550
You should be thanking me.

145
00:12:56,356 --> 00:12:58,825
These are the only mammals on Earth

146
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,829
that have evolved
to feed exclusively on blood.

147
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:04,598
So in order to drink it,

148
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:10,070
these bats produce saliva that
contains unique anticoagulants.

149
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:12,806
So your theory is, if you can
successfully splice

150
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:14,175
vampire genes into your DNA,

151
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:16,177
it would allow your body to produce

152
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,711
those same anticoagulants.

153
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:19,546
Yes.

154
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,514
It would be a cure.

155
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:23,717
At what cost?

156
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,685
The fusion of different species

157
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:29,055
is a legacy
we already carry in our bodies.

158
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,726
Viruses insinuating
their nucleic acid onto our own

159
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:35,428
over hundreds of thousands of years.

160
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:37,164
That's evolution.
This is different.

161
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:38,565
I don't think it is.

162
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:43,536
We have to push the boundaries,
take the risks.

163
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,438
Without that,

164
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:48,109
there is no science.

165
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:49,809
No medicine.

166
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:52,113
No breakthroughs at all.

167
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:01,322
Okay.

168
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:14,302
Test subject
for cell combination 117.

169
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,092
Come on, come on, come on.

170
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:59,146
Test subject 117 has resulted in...

171
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:02,048
failure.

172
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:09,390
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

173
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:14,428
I should've died years ago, Martine.

174
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:18,432
Why am I still alive
if not to fix this?

175
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:21,501
To save my best friend, Milo.

176
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:23,536
And everyone else like us.

177
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,005
Not like this.

178
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,008
Dr. Morbius, it's Anna.

179
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,579
Her temperature's spiking,

180
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,190
and her kidneys are shutting down.

181
00:15:43,324 --> 00:15:47,261
We have to induce a coma
before she has a stroke.

182
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:48,728
A hundred milligrams of propofol.

183
00:15:48,862 --> 00:15:50,697
- Sure.
- Now.

184
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:53,066
Come on.

185
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:56,103
It's okay.

186
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:59,340
It's okay. We got you.

187
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:02,176
There you go.

188
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:04,412
There you go.

189
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,515
Thank you, nurse.

190
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:09,783
We're gonna let you sleep a bit.

191
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:14,921
Take a nice long nap.

192
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:26,833
- Michael.
- What?

193
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:30,070
It worked.

194
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,125
Dr. Michael Morbius.

195
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:55,762
Some
crippled guy's here to see the Boss.

196
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:58,399
Michael! Get over here!

197
00:16:58,532 --> 00:17:02,136
As long
as I am a cripple you'll be fine.

198
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:04,438
<i>♪ Stop dreaming
Of the quiet life... ♪</i>

199
00:17:04,572 --> 00:17:06,840
You're late.
I was trying out

200
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:08,741
this new thing
called "working."

201
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,345
Oh, yeah. I don't believe
I'm familiar with the word.

202
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:13,180
I don't believe you are.

203
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:15,149
So, what's up with the goon squad?

204
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:17,817
Oh, I won a hand of cards
against some Russian gentlemen.

205
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:19,886
Apparently they found
his luck improbable.

206
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:22,323
- There you are.
- More like impossible.

207
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:24,558
So, doctor,
how is our favorite patient?

208
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:27,595
Still determined to make
his short life even shorter?

209
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:29,207
Yes, I am.
Anyway, you're one to talk.

210
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,064
You look terrible.
Look at the state of you.

211
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:34,168
Says the man wearing...
What is that, a quilt?

212
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:36,970
Oh, sorry. I didn't get the memo
to dress for a funeral.

213
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:43,144
Right. I will see you later.

214
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:44,644
And you...

215
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:46,113
my door is always open.

216
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:49,350
We miss you at Horizon.

217
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:50,884
We could use your mind.

218
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:54,687
- I'll leave you two to your fun.
- Bye, Nicholas.

219
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:56,789
I have some good news.

220
00:17:56,923 --> 00:17:58,791
Let's go for a walk.

221
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:01,228
How's Martine doing these days?

222
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:04,365
Dr. Bancroft?
She is, uh, overqualified,

223
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:06,699
outperforming, brilliant as usual.

224
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,636
And a royal pain in my ass.

225
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:11,208
But she's keeping me honest for
the most part. Why do you ask?

226
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:15,209
Eh, no reason. Just haven't
seen you in forever.

227
00:18:15,342 --> 00:18:17,411
I wondered if she had
something to do with it.

228
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,547
Aw, I miss you too.

229
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,550
But, yes, she has been working
with me to save our lives.

230
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:26,220
I could ask her to stop if you
like, put us out of our misery.

231
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:29,055
Just don't do something stupid
and go and fall in love

232
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,558
because, believe you me,

233
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,859
there is absolutely no cure for that.

234
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:34,662
Says the guy who knows
absolutely nothing

235
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,067
- about the subject.
- Not true.

236
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:37,730
I read about it
in books all the time.

237
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:39,866
- Books, really? Wow.
- Yeah.

238
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,702
Or romantic comedies.
The point is...

239
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:46,407
The point is, love is not
on the cards for us, my friend.

240
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,908
Listen, if you start quoting
<i>The Notebook</i> to me,

241
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:51,178
I am going to stop
and hobble very slowly

242
00:18:51,312 --> 00:18:53,180
in the opposite direction.

243
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:54,781
Throw it!

244
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:56,417
I'm close, Milo.

245
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:59,086
I can feel it.

246
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,423
A cure.

247
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,292
It's finally possible.

248
00:19:06,993 --> 00:19:10,763
- Seriously?
- Highly experimental.

249
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:13,467
Ethically questionable.

250
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:17,238
Very, very, very expensive.

251
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:21,475
- I knew that was coming.
- And not exactly legal.

252
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:23,910
Oh, and it has to be done
in international waters.

253
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:28,182
You were always expensive.

254
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:32,286
Is it dangerous?
Should I be worried?

255
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:35,021
- You want me to lie to you?
- That would be nice, yes.

256
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:36,856
It's a walk in the park
on a sunny day.

257
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,559
Oh, yeah, that bad, eh?

258
00:19:40,361 --> 00:19:41,528
Listen.

259
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,031
We don't have much time left.

260
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:49,936
This could be our last chance.

261
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,509
So, what do you say?

262
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:59,313
We go out with a fight?

263
00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:03,617
Yeah.

264
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:08,921
You with me?

265
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:10,823
Till the day you die, brother.

266
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:15,362
Till the day you die.
You'll have everything you need.

267
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:17,864
We're the original Spartans, mate.

268
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:21,669
- The few against the many.
- Yeah.

269
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:32,146
You know, I'm sure you're cheating.

270
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:34,581
No. No, you're not.

271
00:20:34,715 --> 00:20:35,815
What you got?

272
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:37,984
Putting another one in the oven.

273
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:39,653
Wish me luck.

274
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:48,462
The moment of truth.

275
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:08,682
Success, Martine. We did it.

276
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:10,250
It's holding together.

277
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:13,986
Test 243.

278
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:17,491
Human trials.

279
00:21:33,273 --> 00:21:34,575
I'm glad it's you.

280
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:42,483
Had a lot of other suitors,
didn't you?

281
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:44,318
Yeah.

282
00:21:44,451 --> 00:21:46,220
You know, the whole near-death thing

283
00:21:46,353 --> 00:21:48,722
is very, very chic.

284
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,861
I read it in <i>Cosmo.</i>

285
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:56,363
Do they still make <i>Cosmo?</i>
I don't know.

286
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:09,810
I know it's just
what you always wanted.

287
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:12,746
Could be a collector's item
one day, you never know.

288
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,116
This better not be my last one.

289
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,485
I know this is painful,
but you got it.

290
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:25,092
- That's it. Bingo.
- Right there.

291
00:22:29,463 --> 00:22:31,465
Almost there, almost there.

292
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:39,206
It's all right.
Come on. Come on.

293
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:40,874
There you go.

294
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,119
You can buckle me up.

295
00:22:52,252 --> 00:22:54,421
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

296
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:56,723
You all right? Great.

297
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:24,651
I call.

298
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:28,722
- Bringing out the big guns.
- Let's go again.

299
00:23:28,856 --> 00:23:30,791
I'll be back.
I'm gonna check on the doctor.

300
00:23:30,924 --> 00:23:32,092
All right.

301
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:53,447
- You shouldn't be down here.
- I can be wherever I want, nurse.

302
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,382
It's "doctor," actually.

303
00:23:57,084 --> 00:23:59,051
I'm afraid
you're gonna have to leave.

304
00:23:59,186 --> 00:24:02,756
Doctor. Sure, I can see it.

305
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,593
But, uh, you're still the help,
just like me.

306
00:24:06,727 --> 00:24:08,328
Wow.

307
00:24:08,462 --> 00:24:11,231
You can tell all that
by just looking at me, huh?

308
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:14,668
Here I thought you were just
another jacked-up dumb shit.

309
00:24:16,403 --> 00:24:18,070
Get out.

310
00:24:23,877 --> 00:24:26,413
Michael?

311
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:40,928
- Michael?
- Where is he?

312
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,696
Don't move.

313
00:24:44,898 --> 00:24:46,400
What the hell?

314
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:48,735
Everybody down to the lab now.

315
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:50,671
Roger that.

316
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:55,375
Don't shoot!

317
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:06,119
Michael!

318
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:09,623
Stop!

319
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:16,964
Michael.

320
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:22,669
It's just me.

321
00:25:22,803 --> 00:25:23,937
It's just me.

322
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:26,607
Michael, please.

323
00:25:29,142 --> 00:25:30,744
Michael, stop!

324
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:34,181
Stop! Please!

325
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:36,583
You're hurting yourself! Stop!

326
00:25:36,717 --> 00:25:39,753
Hey! Step back! Move!

327
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:42,889
- Stop. Put that gun down...
- Move!

328
00:26:03,477 --> 00:26:05,178
Shit. Close it! Close it!

329
00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:06,747
What the hell is that thing?

330
00:26:23,363 --> 00:26:26,066
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Shit.

331
00:26:32,673 --> 00:26:35,709
- Let's move.
- Go, go, go!

332
00:26:39,113 --> 00:26:41,515
Johnny!

333
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:47,054
Get out of here!

334
00:26:50,757 --> 00:26:52,392
<i>Sweeping Level 3.</i>

335
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:55,129
Jason, come in.

336
00:26:55,262 --> 00:26:56,830
Jason. Jason?

337
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:03,070
Oh, shit.

338
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:06,740
Son of a bitch!

339
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,950
Shit! Oh!

340
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:18,218
Oh, shit!

341
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:04,192
Martine.

342
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:06,693
Martine.

343
00:29:20,674 --> 00:29:21,875
Oh, my God.

344
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:52,505
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

345
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:55,709
This is the <i>LCV Murnau.</i>

346
00:29:55,842 --> 00:29:58,511
Call letters 3-X5Y.

347
00:29:58,645 --> 00:30:01,648
<i>We are 13 nautical miles
off the coast of Long Island.</i>

348
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:04,517
<i>Request immediate airlift.</i>

349
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:08,889
<i>Repeat, this is the</i> LCV Murnau.

00:30:09,022 --> 00:30:12,025
<i>Mayday, mayday, mayday.</i>

351
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:30,244
It's up here to the right.

352
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:34,714
FBI Agent Stroud.
Can we have the room, please?

353
00:30:34,848 --> 00:30:37,251
You heard the man.
Can we please have the room?

354
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:39,819
If you could start exiting,
that'd be fantastic.

355
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,627
Well, we haven't had
anything this good

356
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:49,397
since that thing in San Francisco.

357
00:30:49,562 --> 00:30:51,464
Uh, eight bodies,
running IDs right now,

358
00:30:51,598 --> 00:30:55,702
but apparently they all shop at
the same mercenary supply store.

359
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:58,939
Uh, one survivor,
a Dr. Martine Bancroft.

360
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,142
- Can we talk to her?
- If she wakes up.

361
00:31:01,275 --> 00:31:03,810
Uh, she fell down
and hit her head, apparently.

362
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:06,613
- Anything else?
- Someone made a mayday call.

363
00:31:06,746 --> 00:31:08,481
- Not Dr. Bancroft.
- Nope.

364
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:10,817
It was a male,
didn't identify himself,

365
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:12,719
then wiped
all the surveillance footage.

366
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:14,730
He grew a conscience
and jumped overboard?

367
00:31:14,754 --> 00:31:16,390
It happens. Oh, and get this.

368
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:18,625
All the bodies that you're looking at

369
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:21,695
are nearly drained of their blood.

370
00:31:21,828 --> 00:31:25,266
So, what hunts at night
and drinks human blood?

371
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:29,035
You're gonna love this.

372
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,537
<i>Early this morning</i>

373
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,273
<i>an unmanned cargo ship was discovered</i>

374
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:34,275
<i>near the eastern tip of Long Island</i>

375
00:31:34,408 --> 00:31:35,942
<i>with multiple bodies on board.</i>

376
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:39,113
<i>Authorities are not making
any comment at this time.</i>

377
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:40,981
<i>But there are reports
of one survivor,</i>

378
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:42,482
<i>and we have learned</i>

379
00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:44,185
<i>from a high-ranking Coast
Guard official</i>

380
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:46,354
<i>that the vessel was flying
a Panamanian flag</i>

381
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:49,123
<i>when it drifted in
from international...</i>

382
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:52,926
What's happened?

383
00:31:54,494 --> 00:31:56,297
Some kind of accident.

384
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:02,269
How's your pain today?
On a one to ten?

385
00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:04,771
Eleven.

386
00:32:40,707 --> 00:32:42,209
I'm sorry.

387
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,612
You're going to be okay.

388
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:00,194
Lab 1.

389
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:01,828
Privacy screens.

390
00:33:19,513 --> 00:33:21,781
Come on. Come on.

391
00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:19,939
As a result of my procedure,

392
00:34:20,073 --> 00:34:22,976
<i>I have an overpowering urge
to consume...</i>

393
00:34:25,312 --> 00:34:26,813
<i>blood.</i>

394
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:28,382
Human blood.

395
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:33,987
<i>In certain respects, I have succeeded</i>

396
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:37,391
<i>far beyond anything
I could have imagined.</i>

397
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:41,495
<i>For the first time
in my entire life, I feel...</i>

398
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:42,962
<i>good.</i>

399
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:44,964
<i>Yesterday, I could barely walk.</i>

400
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:48,369
<i>Today, I don't know
what I'm capable of.</i>

401
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:03,450
<i>For a period of time after ingestion,</i>

402
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:04,984
my numbers are off the charts.

403
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,022
I have the constitution
of an Olympic athlete.

404
00:35:09,156 --> 00:35:11,125
<i>Increased strength and speed</i>

405
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:13,160
<i>that can only be described as...</i>

406
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:14,662
<i>superhuman.</i>

407
00:35:14,794 --> 00:35:16,930
<i>And all of this...</i>

408
00:35:17,063 --> 00:35:19,133
<i>on artificial blood.</i>

409
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:32,045
<i>I've become something different.</i>

410
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:33,947
<i>I feel a kinship
with these creatures.</i>

411
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:39,719
<i>They would tear anyone else
apart, but they welcome me.</i>

412
00:35:39,852 --> 00:35:41,522
<i>Like a brother.</i>

413
00:35:57,003 --> 00:36:01,741
<i>I've even developed
a form of echolocation.</i>

414
00:36:01,874 --> 00:36:04,378
<i>Bat radar, for the uninitiated.</i>

415
00:36:06,846 --> 00:36:08,948
<i>The question is:</i>

416
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,950
<i>How do I control it?</i>

417
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,686
Isolate it?

418
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:16,856
Breathe.

419
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:20,860
And let it go.

420
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:54,695
<i>But, unfortunately,
this condition is temporary.</i>

421
00:36:57,797 --> 00:37:00,334
<i>I've been timing myself.</i>

422
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:05,172
<i>Artificial blood keeps me
stable for six hours.</i>

423
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,574
<i>But that window...</i>

424
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:09,576
<i>is growing shorter.</i>

425
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,446
<i>Artificial blood won't work forever.</i>

426
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,116
<i>One question remains:</i>

427
00:37:17,217 --> 00:37:18,652
<i>What if...?</i>

428
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:22,289
<i>What if artificial blood
becomes ineffective?</i>

429
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,858
<i>What happens if I go without?</i>

430
00:37:25,992 --> 00:37:27,695
<i>No blue...</i>

431
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:29,196
<i>No red...</i>

432
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,464
<i>Nothing.</i>

433
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,969
<i>Eventually, my vitals
drop precipitously</i>

434
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:39,506
<i>and my illness returns
with a vengeance.</i>

435
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,710
<i>Soon, I'll face a choice.</i>

436
00:37:44,645 --> 00:37:46,380
<i>Drink the red...</i>

437
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:48,082
<i>or die.</i>

438
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:50,517
<i>But what happened on that ship...</i>

439
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:53,220
<i>can't ever happen again.</i>

440
00:38:21,548 --> 00:38:23,584
Michael.

441
00:38:23,717 --> 00:38:25,152
It's me.

442
00:38:25,285 --> 00:38:26,420
You in here?

443
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:30,657
Where are you?

444
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:36,797
Michael?

445
00:38:36,963 --> 00:38:39,566
Michael? What are you doing?

446
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,570
Michael, it's Milo.
What are you doing?

447
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:46,440
Do you need help?

448
00:38:47,608 --> 00:38:49,143
What?

449
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,418
"Blood."

450
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:02,089
You want the blood
in the freezer? Wait.

451
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:06,693
I'm coming, I'm coming.

452
00:39:06,827 --> 00:39:08,362
I'm coming.

453
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,872
Michael, hang on.

454
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:21,141
Here. Here.

455
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:32,453
Michael...

456
00:39:43,397 --> 00:39:46,333
You're... You're strong.

457
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,168
Michael.

458
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,370
You did it.

459
00:39:50,504 --> 00:39:52,840
You did it.
You found a cure to live.

460
00:39:52,972 --> 00:39:54,208
Michael.

461
00:39:55,742 --> 00:39:57,344
What? What is it?

462
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,813
I've made a terrible mistake, Milo.

463
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:01,882
We all make mistakes.
Don't worry about it.

464
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:03,717
You've never made
one like this before.

465
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:05,051
Michael, enough.

466
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:06,787
Just give it to me. I need it.

467
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,021
I can't live like this
any longer. Please.

468
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,525
- I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

469
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:15,762
- I can't.
- I need this. I...

470
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:17,931
I've done things, Milo.

471
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:23,604
I killed people.

472
00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:26,540
W-we... We can make that go away.

473
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:29,943
The ones on the boat,
they're thugs, guns for hire.

474
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:31,821
- I can make that go away.
- You don't understand.

475
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:35,148
I do understand. Please.
Have I ever denied you anything?

476
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:36,884
Said no?
Have I always given you...?

477
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:39,119
I can't control it!

478
00:40:39,253 --> 00:40:43,423
What, so... So you get to live
and I get to die? Is that it?

479
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:49,363
It's a curse.

480
00:40:49,496 --> 00:40:52,599
Believe me, brother. It is.

481
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:56,336
Now, please, I need you to go.

482
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,070
- It's not safe here.
- No.

483
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,842
No, don't make me go.
Please, Michael, don't...

484
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:03,577
I said, get out!

485
00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:11,818
I said, get out!

486
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:25,666
Milo.

487
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:32,706
She's right here.

488
00:41:35,842 --> 00:41:39,746
Dr. Bancroft?
Agents Stroud and Rodriguez.

489
00:41:41,014 --> 00:41:42,783
How you feeling, doctor?

490
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:46,653
Like I'm in a hospital,
eating really crappy Jell-O.

491
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:48,956
This shouldn't take long.

492
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,624
You were out on a container ship

493
00:41:50,757 --> 00:41:53,327
that washed up off of Long Island.

494
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,963
Doctor, there were
eight dead bodies inside.

495
00:41:56,096 --> 00:42:00,567
We also noticed that their blood
was... What do you call it?

496
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:03,670
Exsanguinated.
I looked it up.

497
00:42:03,804 --> 00:42:07,574
So, um, sorry for the graphic nature

498
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:08,942
of some of these photos.

499
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:10,644
But, um, you're a doctor,

500
00:42:10,777 --> 00:42:13,313
so you know what people
look like on the inside.

501
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,450
These puncture wounds right there,

502
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:18,752
those look like fang marks to you?

503
00:42:26,526 --> 00:42:29,997
Well, you were out there
conducting a major experiment.

504
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,667
We're just hoping
you could shed some light.

505
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,304
Yeah, that...
Not exactly sanitary, isn't it?

506
00:42:38,872 --> 00:42:40,352
I'm having a little bit
of a hard time

507
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,509
remembering what happened that night.

508
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,379
Sure. Let's go.

509
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:53,153
You also work
at the Horizon Lab, right?

510
00:42:53,286 --> 00:42:55,789
With Dr. Michael Morbius.

511
00:42:55,922 --> 00:42:57,057
Yes.

512
00:42:59,793 --> 00:43:01,828
Appreciate your time, doctor.

513
00:43:39,299 --> 00:43:40,467
Hello?

514
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,779
Who's there?

515
00:43:57,884 --> 00:43:59,087
Hello?

516
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,992
<i>Get away from her.
Just step back.</i>

517
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,994
<i>Has she been there all night?</i>

518
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,531
<i>Looks like all the blood
was drained from her body.</i>

519
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:32,746
- Any contusions?
- Not that I can see.

520
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:40,288
Back to our rooms, okay?

521
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,885
Dr. Morbius?

522
00:46:12,986 --> 00:46:14,222
Agent Stroud.

523
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,590
Agent Rodriguez.
Can we have a minute?

524
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:19,160
Of course. How can I help you?

525
00:46:19,293 --> 00:46:21,262
First, I wanna say thank you.

526
00:46:21,394 --> 00:46:22,796
Your artificial blood

527
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:26,533
actually saved my arm
in Afghanistan, sir.

528
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:28,401
I'm glad I could be of service.

529
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,904
I mean, I must admit, doc,
you don't look

530
00:46:31,037 --> 00:46:33,207
anything like you do on the news.

531
00:46:33,341 --> 00:46:35,243
Yeah, you look downright robust.

532
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,978
I have good days and bad.

533
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:39,846
Pilates helps.

534
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,815
How are you on boats?

535
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,384
As you can see...

536
00:46:45,685 --> 00:46:47,754
don't have very good sea legs.

537
00:46:48,955 --> 00:46:50,191
Why do you ask?

538
00:46:50,324 --> 00:46:51,858
'Cause you've been looking for a cure

539
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:54,728
for your condition
your whole life, right?

540
00:46:54,861 --> 00:46:57,964
You've pretty much tried everything.

541
00:46:58,099 --> 00:47:01,768
Crazy experiments, maybe on a boat?

542
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:05,472
"Crazy" isn't a term
that I would use...

543
00:47:05,605 --> 00:47:06,773
detective.

544
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,609
Unorthodox, maybe.

545
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,712
But I'd do just about anything
to save a life.

546
00:47:12,846 --> 00:47:15,383
I'm sure you can understand that.

547
00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:18,618
Anything else I can
help you two with?

548
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,733
<i>All
units, the 120 block, Horizon Labs,</i>

549
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,635
<i>female body drained of blood,
initiate lockdown.</i>

550
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:30,897
Copy that. Doc, got
a couple more questions for you.

551
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:33,767
Yeah, you're coming with us.

552
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:40,040
Hey, freeze!

553
00:47:40,174 --> 00:47:41,309
Stop him!

554
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,246
Hey!

555
00:47:54,587 --> 00:47:56,357
Hold fire!

556
00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:58,658
Get backup and meet me up top.

557
00:48:21,748 --> 00:48:23,284
Enough.

558
00:48:28,955 --> 00:48:31,258
<i>It's worse than I first thought.</i>

559
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:33,760
<i>At this rate, artificial blood
will stop working</i>

560
00:48:33,893 --> 00:48:35,762
<i>in a matter of days.</i>

561
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,699
8:13 p.m.

562
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:46,940
Down from six hours
to four hours, 22 minutes.

563
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,545
I got a problem.

564
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,767
Holy water?

565
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:17,505
- Really?
- What?

566
00:49:17,637 --> 00:49:20,107
I'm not taking any chances.

567
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:21,708
It's triple blessed.

568
00:49:26,347 --> 00:49:29,283
We found this little guy
on the container ship...

569
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,353
with those bodies.

570
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,490
That's a little hobby
of yours, right?

571
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,763
You know, eight dead mercs on a boat

572
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:46,066
really doesn't ruffle our feathers.

573
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,102
I'm pretty sure
they were guilty of something

574
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,003
and happy to have them off the water.

575
00:49:50,137 --> 00:49:55,909
But Nurse Sutton, single mother
with twin girls, that's...

576
00:49:56,042 --> 00:49:59,612
- something else.
- Yes, I know.

577
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,614
Her name was Kristen.
We worked together

578
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,883
every single day for seven years.

579
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:06,786
She was a good person.

580
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,788
So why'd you do it?

581
00:50:13,294 --> 00:50:14,495
I can't answer that.

582
00:50:22,403 --> 00:50:24,838
What did you do to yourself, doctor?

583
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:28,641
- Make us understand.
- I wish I knew.

584
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,747
Okay.

585
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:37,650
Great stuff.
Um, Really informative.

586
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,653
- Thank you. Uh...
- I dropped a bag.

587
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,655
There's something inside that I need.

588
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,891
- Bag of artificial blood.
- Yeah.

589
00:50:45,024 --> 00:50:47,428
Yeah. It's in evidence,
I'm sorry.

590
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:54,335
I'm sorry.

591
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,770
I'm starting to get hungry.

592
00:50:59,373 --> 00:51:01,741
And you don't wanna see me
when I'm hungry.

593
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:08,315
We're done here. Let's go.

594
00:51:11,252 --> 00:51:13,220
Guard!

595
00:51:15,855 --> 00:51:17,458
Your lawyer's here.

596
00:51:30,638 --> 00:51:31,838
You look terrible.

597
00:51:34,974 --> 00:51:36,876
Lawyer, huh?

598
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,346
I don't remember
you ever finishing law school.

599
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,148
'Cause I didn't.

600
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,452
Sit down. Sit down.

601
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,991
I mean, if one of us
was going to end up

602
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:53,893
in bright orange trainers,

603
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,564
I would never have guessed
it would be you.

604
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,468
They're charging me with murder.

605
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,340
I don't know. I don't know.

606
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,076
I...

607
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,245
Maybe I blacked out? Uh...

608
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,548
Hey.

609
00:52:14,682 --> 00:52:16,217
Now listen to me.

610
00:52:18,352 --> 00:52:20,087
I don't believe it.

611
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:22,389
You're not capable of that.

612
00:52:22,523 --> 00:52:27,094
I know that all you've ever
tried to do is help people.

613
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:28,696
You don't belong here.

614
00:52:28,828 --> 00:52:30,029
This place is for terrorists

615
00:52:30,164 --> 00:52:32,065
and drugs lords and God knows who.

616
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:35,703
Michael, we need
to get you out of here.

617
00:52:35,835 --> 00:52:37,171
In whatever way possible.

618
00:52:37,304 --> 00:52:39,240
Maybe this is where I belong.

619
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:42,008
If I'm in here,
then nobody else dies.

620
00:52:42,142 --> 00:52:43,377
Listen to me.

621
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,380
You are not capable
of killing that woman.

622
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,184
Hey, Your Highness, time's up.

623
00:52:51,685 --> 00:52:54,020
Michael, here's something
to keep you going.

624
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:57,625
Guard.

625
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,487
Never too early.

626
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,237
Milo.

627
00:54:01,054 --> 00:54:02,189
Milo!

628
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,195
Let's move!

629
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:34,388
Come on, this way!

630
00:54:43,097 --> 00:54:44,732
Let's go. Let's go.

631
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,100
Open the door.

632
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:48,168
Now! Go!

633
00:54:48,302 --> 00:54:50,036
He's getting away!

634
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,595
<i>Daily Bugle,</i> please, sir.

635
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,365
- There you go, buddy.
- Here you are, my friend.

636
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,468
Always figured that guy for a freak.

637
00:55:21,602 --> 00:55:23,570
How's that?
You've never met him.

638
00:55:23,704 --> 00:55:26,306
I mean, look at him.
What else you need to know?

639
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,610
<i>You know, you shouldn't
judge someone by how they look.</i>

640
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,279
<i>Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?</i>

641
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,381
<i>Take me, for example.</i>

642
00:55:34,515 --> 00:55:36,884
<i>I may look harmless enough.</i>

643
00:55:37,016 --> 00:55:39,286
Do you think I'm joking?

644
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,273
Milo!

645
00:56:01,073 --> 00:56:02,309
Got me.

646
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:04,812
You see? I knew you could do it.

647
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,648
You took the serum
even after I warned you.

648
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,416
What am I gonna do, lay down and die?

649
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:12,119
- Thank you for the death wish.
- I tried to protect you!

650
00:56:12,252 --> 00:56:14,087
Protect me?
Protect me from what?

651
00:56:14,221 --> 00:56:15,522
Becoming a monster like me.

652
00:56:15,656 --> 00:56:18,258
I don't think you're a monster.
Okay?

653
00:56:18,392 --> 00:56:19,959
I killed the nurse.

654
00:56:20,093 --> 00:56:21,628
I killed the nurse.

655
00:56:21,762 --> 00:56:24,631
I know. But you know
what it's like your first time.

656
00:56:24,765 --> 00:56:28,335
You have no idea what you're
doing. You have no control.

657
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:29,670
No.

658
00:56:32,071 --> 00:56:33,941
Milo, you have to stop.

659
00:56:34,073 --> 00:56:37,377
You have to stop. You have
to stop denying who you are.

660
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:40,714
It's boring. We can go anywhere,
we can do anything. Let's go.

661
00:56:40,848 --> 00:56:42,483
Let's have some fun.

662
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:44,218
This isn't you.

663
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:49,289
I know you. Where's the brother
that I used to have?

664
00:56:49,423 --> 00:56:51,425
How can you say that to me?

665
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:54,428
Look what you've become.

666
00:56:54,561 --> 00:56:56,363
Everything I am, I am because of you.

667
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:58,665
I looked up to you my whole life.

668
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,169
I will never leave you,
and I will not go back.

669
00:57:02,302 --> 00:57:05,939
You cannot make me go back.
I won't let you make me go back!

670
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,724
Move, bitch, move!

671
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:37,504
- Goodness.
- Whoo!

672
00:57:38,739 --> 00:57:40,440
We've evolved!

673
00:57:41,675 --> 00:57:43,110
You're a scientist, Michael.

674
00:57:43,243 --> 00:57:46,079
Surely, surely you understand that.

675
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,916
That's not what this is.
This is a mistake.

676
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:52,252
But I can fix it. I'll figure
out how to reverse it.

677
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,755
Artificial blood will keep us
stable until I do.

678
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,057
Yeah, I'm fine just the way
I am, thank you very much.

679
00:57:58,191 --> 00:58:00,260
Hey! Hands up!

680
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,596
- Up against the wall. Now.
- Officer.

681
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,264
- Come on.
- Anything you say.

682
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,333
- You. Don't move.
- Okey-dokey.

683
00:58:08,635 --> 00:58:10,737
We have the suspects.

684
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:12,739
Like we used to say...

685
00:58:12,873 --> 00:58:14,041
live a little.

686
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,047
Hey!

687
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,315
Freeze!

688
00:58:32,459 --> 00:58:36,630
All our lives, we've lived
with death hanging over us.

689
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,298
Why?

690
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,534
Why shouldn't they know
what it feels like

691
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:44,271
for a change, Michael?

692
00:58:44,404 --> 00:58:47,941
Michael!

693
00:58:48,076 --> 00:58:50,277
Michael.

694
00:59:06,927 --> 00:59:08,595
I'm not gonna fight you, Milo.

695
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:26,073
Now he's laying out
officers in my city, huh?

696
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,775
It's unforgiveable.

697
01:00:32,512 --> 01:00:34,915
Just keep your eyes
on Dr. Bancroft.

698
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,450
Yeah.

699
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,840
Woman in the jeans, where'd she go?

700
01:01:33,974 --> 01:01:35,609
Yeah, right.

701
01:01:41,915 --> 01:01:43,117
Great.

702
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:58,565
Hey, stranger.

703
01:02:00,767 --> 01:02:01,902
Michael?

704
01:02:05,739 --> 01:02:07,741
You shouldn't be here.

705
01:02:07,874 --> 01:02:11,578
I didn't kill Nurse Sutton
or the police.

706
01:02:12,712 --> 01:02:14,182
Or any of those people.

707
01:02:16,049 --> 01:02:17,417
I know.

708
01:02:17,551 --> 01:02:18,785
Milo, he...

709
01:02:18,919 --> 01:02:21,955
He took the serum.

710
01:02:22,089 --> 01:02:23,990
He's out there.

711
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,992
And I have to stop him.

712
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,896
But I need your help.

713
01:02:36,369 --> 01:02:37,871
Coffee?

714
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,574
- No, thanks. I quit caffeine.
- It's decaf.

715
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:53,053
Not that kind of vampire.

716
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:54,721
Just checking.

717
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:58,391
I shouldn't have dragged you
out there. I'm sorry.

718
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,527
You didn't.

719
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,129
I wanted to be there.

720
01:03:02,263 --> 01:03:04,731
Well, then apology rescinded.

721
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:06,566
I guess we're both a little crazy.

722
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,034
How do you feel?

723
01:03:08,169 --> 01:03:09,469
Incredible.

724
01:03:09,603 --> 01:03:11,538
I mean, I went from dying
my entire life

725
01:03:11,671 --> 01:03:13,640
to feeling more alive than ever.

726
01:03:13,773 --> 01:03:16,476
Thankfully, artificial blood
keeps me stable.

727
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,712
I just have to drink it more often.

728
01:03:18,845 --> 01:03:20,348
- How often?
- Uh...

729
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,817
Every four hours, 22 minutes.
Down from six.

730
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:26,087
It's losing its effectiveness.

731
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,689
The issue is,
when it stops working...

732
01:03:31,758 --> 01:03:33,627
I'll become like Milo.

733
01:03:35,196 --> 01:03:36,897
You won't.

734
01:03:38,665 --> 01:03:40,634
Hi. Over there.

735
01:03:46,706 --> 01:03:48,142
Sorry, this one's no good.

736
01:03:48,276 --> 01:03:50,710
Check it again.
And keep one for yourself.

737
01:03:50,844 --> 01:03:52,712
No, I don't wanna do it.

738
01:03:52,846 --> 01:03:54,486
There's plenty more
where those came from.

739
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,650
Come on, man,
we gotta get back to the lab.

740
01:04:03,823 --> 01:04:04,958
Michael?

741
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:06,693
Okay, I know that look.

742
01:04:06,826 --> 01:04:08,728
You're up to something.
What is it?

743
01:04:08,862 --> 01:04:10,697
I'll need a couple of things
from the lab.

744
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,366
- Can you do that for me?
- Yes, I can.

745
01:04:12,499 --> 01:04:14,402
But you didn't answer
my question. What is it?

746
01:04:14,534 --> 01:04:16,803
You're right.
I'm up to something.

747
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:28,416
- You got the blood?
- Got it.

748
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:01,315
<i>The ink on this
new batch is pretty legit.</i>

749
01:05:01,449 --> 01:05:03,783
<i>It's a good thing
we switched the chemicals.</i>

750
01:05:03,917 --> 01:05:05,286
<i>Yo, finish up.</i>

751
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:41,721
It's a nice place that you got here.

752
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:44,024
Oh, I love this movie.
Is this the part

753
01:05:44,158 --> 01:05:46,035
where the mysterious guy
with the hoodie comes in

754
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:47,859
and kicks everybody's asses?
I love that part.

755
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:50,916
- Who the hell are you?
- It doesn't matter,

756
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:53,600
but I am gonna need your laboratory.

757
01:05:53,733 --> 01:05:55,653
You can keep the money,

758
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:56,903
all your little toys.

759
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:58,738
Just leave the science-y stuff

760
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:01,342
and that bag of spicy Cheetos.

761
01:06:01,475 --> 01:06:03,177
- He wants my lab?
- Yeah.

762
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:06,280
You trying to be funny?

763
01:06:06,414 --> 01:06:09,316
No, no, no. Absolutely not.
That's their job.

764
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:11,519
I mean, look
at their matching necklaces.

765
01:06:11,651 --> 01:06:13,087
Time to go.

766
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:18,024
Did you know that there are
27 bones in the human hand?

767
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:19,326
Allow me

768
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:21,728
to introduce the phalanges.

769
01:06:21,861 --> 01:06:23,230
The metacarpals.

770
01:06:23,364 --> 01:06:24,804
Shit.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

771
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:27,501
And the pretty, little stinky pinkie.

772
01:06:30,703 --> 01:06:32,839
- Who the hell are you, man?
- Me?

773
01:06:32,972 --> 01:06:36,609
I am Venom.

774
01:06:38,512 --> 01:06:40,814
You can go now.

775
01:06:43,384 --> 01:06:47,088
Six to eight weeks,
a little ibuprofen.

776
01:06:47,221 --> 01:06:49,589
Should heal up just fine.

777
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,611
Yo. Can I get a tequila, please?

778
01:08:17,744 --> 01:08:19,146
Don Julio 1942.

779
01:08:29,789 --> 01:08:31,458
Do I know you?

780
01:08:31,592 --> 01:08:32,792
Me?

781
01:08:32,926 --> 01:08:35,296
- Yeah.
- No, I don't think so.

782
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,031
We've met.

783
01:08:38,165 --> 01:08:40,401
- I'm sure of it.
- No, I'd remember.

784
01:08:41,602 --> 01:08:43,337
You're too pretty.

785
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:46,940
You know what they say, "Tequila
to remember, whiskey to forget."

786
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:49,709
That's good.

787
01:08:49,842 --> 01:08:51,579
Sir, two tequilas, please.

788
01:08:54,648 --> 01:08:56,283
Hey, yo.

789
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:00,221
Her drinks are spoken for, bro.

790
01:09:00,354 --> 01:09:02,423
<i>Salute.</i>

791
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:06,025
You know, uh, ahem,
I'm gonna do you a favor

792
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,295
and let you walk out of here,
all right?

793
01:09:08,429 --> 01:09:09,729
That's very kind of you.

794
01:09:09,862 --> 01:09:12,031
Here was I thinking
you were a complete asshole.

795
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,866
- Sir, can I get my friend here...
- Relax.

796
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,238
...and his friends
a round of whiskeys?

797
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:21,542
Hey!

798
01:09:28,182 --> 01:09:29,782
I'll get you another drink.

799
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:32,419
Hey.

800
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:35,689
Another time.

801
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:39,926
Jerk.

802
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:45,499
You see the size of that guy?
I'm not paying for those drinks.

803
01:10:18,565 --> 01:10:20,167
Martine.

804
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:24,672
Milo.

805
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,005
Sorry. I let myself in.

806
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:28,509
I hope I didn't startle you.

807
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:30,344
It's okay.

808
01:10:30,477 --> 01:10:32,122
If I'd known
our biggest funder was coming,

809
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:35,416
I would have planned
a nice dinner for us.

810
01:10:37,884 --> 01:10:40,087
Actually, I've already eaten.

811
01:10:43,457 --> 01:10:46,126
Whatever it is, it's doing
wonders for your health.

812
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:51,231
I feel great.

813
01:10:51,365 --> 01:10:53,701
- What can I do for you?
- Well, it's Michael.

814
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,068
I'm worried about him.

815
01:10:55,202 --> 01:10:57,471
He's alone out there.

816
01:10:57,604 --> 01:11:00,840
And I think he needs me.

817
01:11:00,973 --> 01:11:04,211
If I can get to him before
the police do, I can help him.

818
01:11:04,345 --> 01:11:07,247
You wouldn't happen to know
where he is, would you?

819
01:11:07,381 --> 01:11:10,584
You two have always been so close.

820
01:11:10,718 --> 01:11:12,419
I'm sorry.

821
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:15,356
I don't.

822
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,960
Hmm.

823
01:11:24,131 --> 01:11:25,332
Just to be sure,

824
01:11:25,466 --> 01:11:27,634
I'm going to ask you one more time.

825
01:11:29,603 --> 01:11:32,840
You don't happen to know
where he is, do you, Martine?

826
01:11:32,972 --> 01:11:34,808
I wouldn't lie to you, Milo.

827
01:11:37,944 --> 01:11:39,079
I don't.

828
01:11:43,817 --> 01:11:46,420
Now, if you don't mind,
I have work to do.

829
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:48,188
Okay.

830
01:11:48,322 --> 01:11:51,125
Well, if you see him,
if you hear from him, tell him:

831
01:11:51,258 --> 01:11:54,261
"We are the few
against the many."

832
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:58,365
We'll have to do that dinner
another time, Martine.

833
01:12:24,825 --> 01:12:26,293
Police!

834
01:12:35,202 --> 01:12:36,470
Clear!

835
01:12:38,172 --> 01:12:39,606
Clear!

836
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:51,285
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

837
01:12:57,591 --> 01:13:01,528
Cat's gone. And she's
probably gone along with it.

838
01:13:05,632 --> 01:13:07,534
It's time to eat, you little monster.

839
01:13:07,668 --> 01:13:08,802
Oh!

840
01:13:10,838 --> 01:13:12,139
Shit.

841
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:21,148
Michael?

842
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:24,351
Hey.

843
01:13:25,486 --> 01:13:27,087
Michael.

844
01:13:27,221 --> 01:13:28,922
I'm sorry.

845
01:13:32,559 --> 01:13:34,495
You may wanna close that up.

846
01:13:34,628 --> 01:13:35,796
Yep.

847
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:47,374
How does it feel...

848
01:13:47,508 --> 01:13:49,376
when you're on red?

849
01:13:51,512 --> 01:13:54,448
Something wakes up
inside of me, something...

850
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:58,252
primal.

851
01:14:00,988 --> 01:14:02,656
And it just, uh...

852
01:14:05,859 --> 01:14:07,661
And it wants to hunt.

853
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:11,598
And wants to kill.

854
01:14:17,738 --> 01:14:19,239
I'm sorry.

855
01:14:51,004 --> 01:14:52,372
Hi.

856
01:14:55,342 --> 01:14:56,543
Good as new.

857
01:14:56,677 --> 01:14:59,146
Nice work, doctor.

858
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:01,315
Thank you, doctor.

859
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:05,953
You know, for the record, I...

860
01:15:06,086 --> 01:15:09,923
I wasn't gonna go
full Dracula on you downstairs.

861
01:15:10,057 --> 01:15:11,825
For the record...

862
01:15:11,959 --> 01:15:14,928
I find him to be quite the romantic.

863
01:15:15,062 --> 01:15:16,997
Come here.

864
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:18,999
Just close your eyes.

865
01:15:20,701 --> 01:15:21,835
Okay.

866
01:15:23,403 --> 01:15:24,838
Move closer.

867
01:15:51,365 --> 01:15:54,501
Did you know the average male
body has 12 pints of blood?

868
01:15:54,635 --> 01:15:57,504
I mean, how much do you think
the doctor can drink?

869
01:15:57,638 --> 01:15:58,939
I don't know.

870
01:15:59,072 --> 01:16:00,974
When's the last time
you had 36 beers?

871
01:16:01,109 --> 01:16:03,877
When's the last time
you had any beers?

872
01:16:08,082 --> 01:16:10,183
CCTV.

873
01:16:10,317 --> 01:16:12,019
I'll go grab the footage.

874
01:16:12,152 --> 01:16:14,721
I don't want you
to have to move or anything.

875
01:16:18,492 --> 01:16:20,727
All right, check this out.

876
01:16:27,934 --> 01:16:29,302
Wait, wait, wait.

877
01:16:29,436 --> 01:16:32,773
Zoom in. And hold right there.

878
01:16:34,975 --> 01:16:36,843
That's not the doctor.

879
01:16:36,977 --> 01:16:39,713
It's what these
bloodsuckers do. They multiply.

01:17:29,362 --> 01:17:31,099
I mean, look at me.

898
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,602
I am reborn.

899
01:17:35,736 --> 01:17:37,938
I am the resurrection.

900
01:17:39,339 --> 01:17:41,775
My God, what have you done
to yourself?

901
01:17:41,908 --> 01:17:43,944
What?

902
01:17:44,078 --> 01:17:45,979
Do you disapprove?

903
01:17:46,114 --> 01:17:49,483
What's the matter, Nicholas?
Is Daddy cross?

904
01:17:49,616 --> 01:17:51,384
All right. Settle down.

905
01:17:51,518 --> 01:17:53,154
Let's go and have a drink together.

906
01:17:53,286 --> 01:17:54,554
Come celebrate with me, please.

907
01:17:54,688 --> 01:17:55,956
- No.
- Just one drink.

908
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:59,093
Milo, you're scaring me.
Please. Just...

909
01:17:59,227 --> 01:18:01,795
Just... Just calm down.

910
01:18:11,172 --> 01:18:14,875
- What's the matter?
- I can't... I can't sleep.

911
01:18:15,008 --> 01:18:17,944
I can help you with that.

912
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:21,815
I've been more than a friend
to you all this time, Milo.

913
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:24,484
And I'm going to stay here with you.

914
01:18:26,187 --> 01:18:29,790
But there will be
no more violence, understand?

915
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,894
That doesn't do it for me.

916
01:18:35,762 --> 01:18:38,498
I should have known.
You always take his side.

917
01:18:38,632 --> 01:18:40,967
Tell me your side, then, Milo.

918
01:18:41,102 --> 01:18:43,436
Michael doesn't accept
what he is, Nicholas.

919
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:45,005
I'm gonna make him accept it.

920
01:18:45,139 --> 01:18:49,309
- By ruining his good name?
- See? There! There you are!

921
01:18:49,442 --> 01:18:53,313
Perfect Michael, selfless
Michael, Michael the favorite!

922
01:18:53,446 --> 01:18:55,015
Don't be childish, Milo!

923
01:18:55,149 --> 01:18:57,194
If anyone has a claim
to being my favorite, it's you.

924
01:18:57,218 --> 01:18:59,753
- I've devoted my life to you.
- Liar.

925
01:19:03,257 --> 01:19:04,991
You pitied me before.

926
01:19:06,927 --> 01:19:10,363
You did. You pitied me before.
You're repulsed by me now.

927
01:19:10,497 --> 01:19:13,033
I am repulsed...

928
01:19:13,167 --> 01:19:15,068
by what you've done,

929
01:19:15,203 --> 01:19:17,171
by what you've become.

930
01:19:20,674 --> 01:19:24,644
Whatever this thing is...

931
01:19:24,778 --> 01:19:27,347
you're not up to it.

932
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,850
There's no shame in what we are.

933
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:35,655
"We are the few..."

934
01:19:37,291 --> 01:19:39,826
"Against the many."

935
01:19:45,532 --> 01:19:47,400
Tell Michael,

936
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:49,454
you tell him I'm going to kill
as many as I want.

937
01:20:01,381 --> 01:20:04,951
"He's only destroyed
by a stake through the heart,

938
01:20:05,086 --> 01:20:08,356
made from the wood
of the Holy Cross."

939
01:20:08,488 --> 01:20:10,423
You don't believe this.

940
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:15,028
No. But after the week
that I've had, anything is possible.

941
01:20:16,197 --> 01:20:17,331
What is that?

942
01:20:17,464 --> 01:20:21,434
This is an antibody.

943
01:20:21,568 --> 01:20:25,906
It inhibits ferritin,
induces a massive iron overload,

944
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:28,008
instant hemochromatosis.

945
01:20:29,377 --> 01:20:32,412
Deadly to bats, fatal to humans.

946
01:20:33,513 --> 01:20:35,182
Okay.

947
01:20:35,316 --> 01:20:37,118
Who's the second one for?

948
01:20:40,921 --> 01:20:43,857
My window's closing.
We both know that.

949
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:46,193
By tomorrow I'll be forced
to consume human blood.

950
01:20:46,327 --> 01:20:47,761
I can't do that.
I won't do that.

951
01:20:47,894 --> 01:20:49,696
So this is your solution, huh?

952
01:20:50,764 --> 01:20:52,732
Injecting yourself with poison?

953
01:20:52,866 --> 01:20:55,202
I brought this into the world.

954
01:20:57,604 --> 01:20:59,373
It's up to me to take it out.

955
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:08,048
I need you to go now.
It's not safe here. Okay?

956
01:21:22,729 --> 01:21:24,998
Nicholas, you okay?

957
01:21:25,132 --> 01:21:27,968
<i>Michael, I need help.</i>

958
01:21:30,137 --> 01:21:33,039
<i>I went to see Milo.</i>

959
01:21:33,174 --> 01:21:35,343
Nicholas?

960
01:21:35,475 --> 01:21:37,144
Nicholas!

961
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:02,203
Nicholas.

962
01:22:05,172 --> 01:22:06,374
Nicholas?

963
01:22:09,443 --> 01:22:10,910
- Michael.
- Come on,

964
01:22:11,044 --> 01:22:13,280
we have to get you to a hospital.

965
01:22:15,782 --> 01:22:19,320
You have to stop him.

966
01:22:38,004 --> 01:22:39,473
<i>Michael.</i>

967
01:22:40,874 --> 01:22:43,043
<i>Michael.</i>

968
01:22:43,177 --> 01:22:44,878
Call out for him.

969
01:22:46,813 --> 01:22:48,215
I want him to hear you.

970
01:22:48,349 --> 01:22:50,184
- No.
- Yeah.

971
01:22:50,317 --> 01:22:53,421
<i>I won't ask you again.</i>

972
01:22:53,553 --> 01:22:56,424
<i>Say, "Michael."</i>

973
01:22:57,891 --> 01:22:59,326
<i>Michael.</i>

974
01:23:01,162 --> 01:23:02,862
<i>Good girl.</i>

975
01:23:04,398 --> 01:23:06,100
<i>Michael.</i>

976
01:23:08,536 --> 01:23:11,372
<i>- Michael.
- Yeah.</i>

977
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:18,745
<i>Michael.</i>

978
01:23:21,748 --> 01:23:23,250
<i>Milo.</i>

979
01:23:24,717 --> 01:23:27,121
You're hurting me.

980
01:23:27,254 --> 01:23:28,788
It's okay.

981
01:24:08,562 --> 01:24:09,696
Martine?

982
01:24:11,098 --> 01:24:14,101
Let me take a look. Martine.

983
01:24:14,235 --> 01:24:16,170
- Let me look.
- It's bad.

984
01:24:18,037 --> 01:24:19,573
Michael.

985
01:24:19,706 --> 01:24:21,275
Make it mean something.

986
01:24:22,642 --> 01:24:24,345
I can help you.

987
01:24:30,317 --> 01:24:31,585
I'm sorry.

988
01:25:31,645 --> 01:25:33,080
Drank the red.

989
01:25:34,181 --> 01:25:35,449
Good for you.

990
01:25:36,983 --> 01:25:39,253
It's just you and me, Michael!

991
01:25:39,386 --> 01:25:41,955
Nothing, no one, to hold us back.

992
01:25:42,089 --> 01:25:44,924
I'm all you have left.

993
01:25:45,058 --> 01:25:48,596
That's the spirit. Yeah.

994
01:26:51,692 --> 01:26:53,093
Bye.

995
01:27:32,266 --> 01:27:34,867
Come on, Michael!

996
01:27:35,001 --> 01:27:36,936
Come on!

997
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:40,174
You can do better than this!

998
01:27:40,307 --> 01:27:42,376
It's not a curse.

999
01:27:42,509 --> 01:27:43,811
It's a gift.

1000
01:27:43,943 --> 01:27:45,878
You started this, you created this,

1001
01:27:46,012 --> 01:27:47,847
you created us!

1002
01:30:28,275 --> 01:30:29,843
Michael.

1003
01:30:29,977 --> 01:30:31,545
You can't kill me.

1004
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,616
I mean, it's me.

1005
01:30:37,451 --> 01:30:39,286
You can't kill me.

1006
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:52,799
You gave me my name.

1007
01:30:54,368 --> 01:30:55,969
Remember?

1008
01:30:57,871 --> 01:30:59,640
I remember everything.

1009
01:31:02,376 --> 01:31:03,710
I'm sorry.

1010
01:31:22,796 --> 01:31:24,231
Lucian.

1011
01:32:02,936 --> 01:32:06,006
- Stay back, people.
- Get back! Back!

1012
01:34:26,214 --> 01:34:29,117
Hope the food's better in this joint.

1013
01:34:29,249 --> 01:34:31,384
<i>The bizarre story developing</i>

1014
01:34:31,518 --> 01:34:33,320
<i>at the Manhattan Detention Center</i>

1015
01:34:33,453 --> 01:34:36,723
<i>when a man identifying himself
as Adrian Toomes</i>

1016
01:34:36,857 --> 01:34:40,128
<i>simply appeared
in an otherwise empty cell.</i>

1017
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,895

1018
01:34:42,028 --> 01:34:45,532
<i>that could likely lead

1019
01:36:55,896 --> 01:36:58,266
Thanks for meeting me, doc.

1020
01:36:58,398 --> 01:37:00,000
I've been reading about you.

1021
01:37:00,134 --> 01:37:03,036
- I'm listening.
- I'm not sure how I got here.

1022
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:06,107
Has to do with Spider-Man, I think.

1023
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:08,074
I'm still figuring this place out,

1024
01:37:08,209 --> 01:37:11,379
but I think a bunch of guys
like us should team up.

1025
01:37:11,511 --> 01:37:13,446
Could do some good.

1026
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:14,848
Intriguing.
